# üè† Housing Price Prediction

An **end-to-end machine learning project** to predict house prices from structured/tabular features (location, size, rooms, age, amenities, etc.).
Covers the full workflow: **EDA, feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployable inference pipelines.**
